# IRTÂ® - Instagram Reporter Tool

This Python script can be used to report Instagram accounts for certain violations. After users enter a specific Instagram username, the script automatically retrieves the Instagram User ID of that account. Users can then select a reason to report that account and, if necessary, report multiple accounts simultaneously using multithreading.

# Requirements
Python 3 is required to run this script. It also requires the standard libraries requests, re, time, and random, and the multiprocessing module.
# Installation
Before running the script, run the following command in the terminal or command prompt to install the required modules:

# Usage
When you run the script, a text file with users (users.txt) and a text file with proxy servers (proxy.txt) are loaded.

Optionally, you can speed up reports using multithreading.
